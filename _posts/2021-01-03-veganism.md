## The suffering of sentient beings

I have been a carnivore for most of my life and
only switched to a vegetarian lifestyle three years ago.
I did not only like meat, but I was also proud of it, the diet was part of my identity.
Vegetarians and vegans were strange people in my world view.
Who just didn't understand that nature is cruel and animals are for human consumption.

For two month I am also trying to adhere to a diet free of animal products.
Please, question everything you read here, and if you find anything that
is contradicting feel free to contact me.

Most of these ideas are adapted from Peter Singer,
Alex O'Conner, and [Brian Tomasik](https://reducing-suffering.org).
If you haven't read Peter Singer I would highly suggest giving it a try.
He was it in the first place that convinced me
that we must consider animals in our moral landscape.

Veganism has a bad reputation because it is often seen as a cult or religion
which is what repels people from giving it any thought or a throughout examination.
A lot of things that I bring forth might offend you,
but please think about them and evaluate the merits of each argument.

So what is veganism and how can we define it?
To quote Wikipedia: "Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of
animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects
the commodity status of animals.
An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan."
This definition seems sufficient to continue the discussion of veganism.
To shorten this into bullet points it has 2 important points:

- no animal products
- animals are no commodity

One thing is really important to remember: Veganism is not a diet,
it is a lifestyle that chooses to minimize the suffering of sentient beings.

## Morals

The following points are based on my moral principles, mainly to avoid suffering
in sentient beings.
I would not call myself a stringent utilitarian because I don't think that there
is a strict moral currency that can be applied to situations.
However, I do think that utilitarianism has some interesting concepts.
Furthermore, I would see my morals more on the ground of negative utilitarianism
because I do think that suffering is to be avoided and that suffering outweighs
pleasue in most circumstances.
Nonetheless, I think strict utilitarianism will lead to extermist views
and assumptive conclusions.
Now that we have some background on my morals, I want to present arguments
*against* veganism.

## Discussion of arguments against veganism

### Culture and nature

I like to start with a common attack against vegans that eating animals is
part of the culture and a natural way of living.
This first argument is a bandwagon fallacy
(see [here](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon)).
Appealing to culture or that everyone is doing it can be easily dismantled by
stating that we also used to have slaves or that women had fewer rights than men.
In the context of culture, there is no sound moral justification/explanation as to
why we can abolish slavery,
but not the killing of billions of innocent sentient beings.
Humans have always adapted to new cultures and laws otherwise we would not be living
in the society we currently have.

Especially the natural argument has always baffled me because
I don't understand what
"natural" even means.
Is flying in airplanes natural? Is driving in cars natural?
What is this natural we seek to live?
Should we all be living in caves and kill each other over trivia?
A definition of natural is pretty damn difficult and I don't think it bears any value.
Maybe the obsession with natural/nature stems from religious contexts as nature
can be viewed as something sacred. Something that should not be interfered with.
My views on religion are not discussed in this blog, but I will write an article
in the future.
Maybe what people mean with natural is that we can only get sufficient nutrients
with an omnivore diet as we might have evolved to eating meat.
But does this hold up with the current recommendations of official health institutes?

### Nutrition deficits

I am by no means a certified nutritionist so you might want to skip this chapter
as I can only repeat what official sources are telling.
Many institutes like the American Dietetic Association \[[1](#reference-list)\],
the Dietitians Australia \[[2](#reference-list)\], and the Paedriatics Child
Health \[[3](#reference-list)\] state that vegan diets can be healthy.
However, they do also state that it requires additional considerations such as
supplementing essential vitamins such as B12 (Zinc, Iod, Calcium, etc.).
This does not sound like veganism is an unhealthy or dangerous diet. Nonetheless,
it requires some additional effort from the consumer.
Now you might think that this is not worth the hustle, but hold on for a short
as we will explore the benefits later on.
For completeness sake I want also to include that the DGE (Germany) does not
recommend a vegan diet "during pregnancy or lactation, or for children or
adolescents of any age." \[[4](#reference-list)]
Their main reason seems to be that it is easier to be malnourished with a vegan
diet, especially if one is not educated on the subject.
However, malnutrition can also happen on an omnivore diet and most people are not
educated on nutritional requirements.
On a side note: If you want to get a good understanding of nutrition,
I would highly recommend that you check out [examine.com](www.examine.com).
I have no affiliation with them, but they are a treasure for unbiased reviews
and recommendations.

I think it is fair to say that most adults should be safe with a vegan diet and
even some institutes \[[5](#reference-list)]
include children in their recommendations as long as they get all nutrients.

If you plan on going vegan, please do your research on nutritients
and what must be supplemented for a healthy diet!

### I don't care about animals or their suffering

![piglets](/assets/images/pigs.jpg)

This might sound like a ridiculous statement to you, however, every person is
entitled to her/his opinion.
Yet, this claim is often due to cognitive dissonance.
Let me explain what I mean by that:
Suppose you do not care about the suffering of animals.
What about the suffering of babies and mentally disabled people?
If you care about those why do you exclude nonhumans?
What characteristics do animals lack that the aforementioned humans do have?
A lot of animals like pigs do have similar cognitive/emotional/social abilities
as children \[[6](#reference-list)].
Yet we do only consider the latter as worthy of living and the other as a commodity.
The word I am referring to here is speciesism.
Granting moral value to humans, but not to other species such as pigs or chickens.
Sentient beings do not derive their moral worth through being part of a species
or race, rather we should consider the moral worth of a being through the
capabilities of said being to experience suffering.
Furthermore, if you are using Genes as a measurement of your eating preferences
then it might surprise you that we share most of our genes with mammals
and other related animals.

## Arguments for veganism

### Moral considerations

Because we can derive all nutrients from a vegan diet,
the only logical argument for eating animal products comes from their taste
(however if I am missing other considerations please let me know!).
So the question we have to ask every time we eat a product where an animal has
been abused is the following: Does the pleasure of the taste justify
the suffering of a being?
Honestly, I find it pretty difficult to morally defend the taste of something
against the suffering of this being.
In the beginning, I mentioned utilitarianism and how I think a value currency is
difficult to define.
It might be difficult to compare the pleasure during eating with the suffering
associated with that pleasure, but due to alternatives and the ever-growing
industry around replacement products, it is morally difficult to argue
that animal products have to be part of our diet.
Here, I would also like to use the cognitive dissonance many people in our society
embrace: On the one hand, eating animals like pigs and chickens and on the other
hand welcoming dogs into their family homes. What are the moral justifications
for this?
They surely can not be due to the cognitive/emotional/social abilities of these
animals. As pigs are similar to dogs in this regard.

### Environmental facts

I don't want to go into details here because it is not the main point of this
blog, but for completeness, I will use a citation without commentary:
"All told, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with livestock supply
chains add up to 7.1 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) per
year – or 14.5 percent of all human-caused GHG releases." \[[7](#reference-list)]

### Wild animal suffering

I am having difficulties fathoming the innumerable suffering in the wild.
It is probably several factors greater compared to all animal
mass-producing facilities.
Natural selection and nature are brutal. Species produce
many offsprings so that a few can survive. Starvation and being eaten
are probably the leading causes of death and most of these are associated
with a prolonged period of suffering. But what can we do about this?
Honestly, I currently don't know and my best guess is that research
and science can provide partial answers to these problems.
The only thing I am certain about is that these topics should be discussed.
However, we have to be cautious that our actions will not produce more
suffering because of the complexities involved.

## What is left?

I hope this short introduction to veganism has sparked some discussion inside
you and if not I hope you will sometimes revisit the arguments.
Veganism is often portrayed as a radical lifestyle, it might be argued that
eating sentient beings and their products can be defined as a more radical
lifestyle. We are used to it and we think it is acceptable because everyone
is doing it.
Change is only possible if we question our beliefs and values and act accordingly.
My dearest hope is that future generations will look at our times and be
disgusted by the way we treated animals.
Finally, I want to spark your imagination, think about being a pig in
a mass production facility.
From birth on you are treated as an object, your world consists of feces,
dirt, and steel fences that prevent you from moving any further than a few meters.
You have no connection to your mother because she was confined to a tiny spot
to lay down and produce milk for you and your siblings.
Some of your siblings were too weak to survive so a worker
from the facility killed them with a few hits on the head.
You are numb, you know nothing of this world. The older you get,
the heavier you become. You are crammed with other fellow pigs and moving around
or playing outside is not possible.
These workers are stressed out and sometimes seem very angry with you.
But you have no idea why. Then comes the day where you are put into a transporter
and brought to a house where people use sticks to hit you so that you move in
the right direction. This place is even smaller than the old one.
You lay on the concrete and everything hurts.
Some of your fellow beings seem exhausted from the travel.
The next morning some worker uses sticks to bring you and nine others to another
room. But somehow he closes the door behind you. Suddenly, you can't breathe anymore,
you get irritated, you cry out for help, your fellow companions do the same.
But there is nothing other than sterile machines and metallic noises.
You panic, stumble and after a while of this excruciating pain, you become unconscious.
The worker puts a strap around your legs which pulls you up and another worker
sticks a knife into your throat which makes you bleed to death.

I don't like arguments that appeal to emotions because it might suppress the
rational side of the argument.
However, this is the reality we live in and the package in the supermarket does not
tell you anything about it. Even worse it displays happy animals
in nature who have nothing in common with the majority of animals that are
slaughtered for their meat.
This or similar experiences are the reality for billions of animals every year.
There is no clean consciousness. We are part of this problem.
No cognitive dance can mitigate the reality. These beings suffer for our pleasure.
I can not go on living like we are gods to these animals and without doing
anything about these atrocities. Think for yourself and if you do not like to suffer
why should they like to suffer? I was born so privileged and the chances that I
happened to be where I am now are so small,
I could as well have been born in a war-torn region
or as an animal that experiences only suffering and death.
We have done nothing to deserve this privilege, but we can use it to help other
beings. Mass production and wild animal suffering are immediate problems.
The former can be solved by our consumption, the latter needs many intelligent
people for researching and finding solutions to complex problems.
But you have a choice right now.
